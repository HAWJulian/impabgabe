# uFrame

Full uFrame has now been completely open sourced.  Use uFrame Architect, and ECS to build awesome games/apps or create your own uFrame spinned framework, the choice is up to you.

## MVVM Users
The current version of MVVM needs to be ported to the 2.0 engine.  But instead of porting a seperate framework, you might as well just extends uFrame ECS to have some MVVM like features, considering ECS has the same kernel as well as UniRX included with it.  Simply a View Class and a binding layer would do the trick.

## Create your own
Here's some idea of what it would be really cool to see the community come up with that we have never really shared.
- Hierarchical State Machines
- Menu Flow similar to Microsoft Blends pageflow.
- Other frameworks such as strangeIOC, Entitas... etc

## Documentation, Documentation, Documentation
If anyone is interested in documenting uFrame please contribute here, it needs all the help it can get, and architect/uFrame Editor stuff desperately needs some documentation attention.
